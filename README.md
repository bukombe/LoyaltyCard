# Android NFC Loyalty Card
NFC Loyalty Card for Android

Only 2 things needed for a Digital Loyalty Card...  An Android Phone and an NFC Tag (Very Cheap, you can get 20 (NTAG213) for $20.00 on Amazon) You can download a Free NFC Tag Writer like NFC Tools (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc) and write the text to the tag.  No expensive hardware or Internet based tracking software required.  You can't get any closer to an actual Punch Card than this.

As a Store Owner you would program a Tag with your Store Name.  If you change the tag, all users will need to reset the app to clear the currently paired Tag.

As a User, you would download the App and Tap the Tag to register it with the app and get your first Credit.

Each Tap on the paired NFC Tag earns 1 credit. Once the "FREE" item is redeemed, the card clears to start over.

Only 3 icons needed to customize for your store.  Not Punched, Punched and Punched Free.
You could use a Coffee cup, Sandwich, Ice Cream Cone, Car Washes, Oil Change, Muffins, Haircut, ...  You get the idea; the possibilities are endless.

Anyone want to make iOS version :-)


Store Owner - Program NFC tag with your Store Name Write another - Write another TAG that has a link to the App on Google Play.

Todo list

* Change cards to Fragments. I think this is what is need to have multiple accounts.
* Allow multiple card accounts
	Store each NFC Tag with a Company Name
		Currently the Card Name is pulled from the Te4xt Filed on th TAG and can be set manually, but this is only for 1 Tag.
