# Android NFC Loyalty Card
NFC Loyalty Card for Android

Only 2 things needed for a Digital Loyalty Card...  An Android Phone and an NFC Tag (Very Cheap, you can get 20 (NTAG213) for $20.00 on Amazon) You can download a Free NFC Tag Writer like NFC Tools (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc) for and write the text to the tag.  No expensive hardware or Internet based trackng software required.  You can't get any closer to an actual Punch Card than this.

Each Tap on a paired NFC Tag earns 1 credit. Once the "FREE" item is redeemed, the card clears to start over.

Only 3 icons needed to customize for your store.  Not Punched, Punched and Punched Free.
You could use a Coffee cup, Sandwich, Ice Cream, Car washes, Oil Change, Muffins, Haircut, ...  You get the idea.
Now I just need someone to do an iOS version :-)


Todo list

* Allow registration of NFC so no hard coding is required (DONE)
* Allow multiple card accounts
	Store each NFC Tag with a Company Name
